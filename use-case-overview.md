# 2. Use Case Overview

You are a business automation specialist consultant who was hired by a bank, Pecunia Corp. They need you to automate a critical scenario: the _Loan Approval Process_.

The bank can save resources and provide a better customer experience by using an automated repeatable process, that leverages  business rules and provides the right input for a single user task - when necessary. With this, the team can pay attention to the loan requests that were approved instead of performing repeated manual tasks that are error prone.

In this scenario, you should be able to automate the process by authoring the process and the decision logic using a more natural language for the business users.

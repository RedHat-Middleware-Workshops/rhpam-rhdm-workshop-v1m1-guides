# The Business Background

It is your first day working in the IT Team of Pecunia Corp. This bank has a division named _Issuer_, and one of the most common, yet expensive, tasks is the dispute of a credit card transaction.

One of the processes that the bank has identified as a candidate for automation is the _credit card dispute_ process. The processing cost of this business process is very high, regardless of the amount that is being disputed. Also, it is also a heavily regulated process that requires audit trails and mandatory steps to be taken.

In this workshop we will automate this process to:

- reduce the processing cost;
- improve customer satisfaction by reducing turnaround time through automation;
- make decisions reproducible by automating business rules;
- provide insight into the process, enabling the use of analytics to analyse and optimize the dispute process.
